# Work Day Scheduler 

This appilication utilizes third party APIs like Bootstrap, Jquery, and Moment.js to create a work day scheduler

The work day scheduler breaks up the day into hour time slots and color codes those timeblocks by present, past, and future to let you know how far along the day is in reference to your tasks

After entering a task and clicking the save button, your task will be saved regardless of refreshing the page or closing it out completely!
